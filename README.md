## PC Optimization For The 21st Century ##

**[FLCleaner 3.0][flcleaner.com]** is **stack manager** software (designed to optimize computing systems).

Whilst working similarly to other PC optimization tools, it has a distinct difference in that it works on the *platform* level, rather than system. Its purpose is to help system administrators manage the [solution stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack) in real time â†´

-- <br />
Calling the product a "stack manager" doesn't mean it works differently.

The product works inasmuch the same way as other PC Optimization tools - checking your system for pre-defined criteria & prompting you to "fix" the inconsistencies. The difference lies in *how* it does this.

## Open Source ##

**But WAIT!** <br />
Is this a **SCAM?** Why are you *giving away* the source?

Committing to open source was a major decision for us.

Whilst it would have been beneficial to keep the product secret, we felt the benefits outweighed the pitfalls. Specifically, the loss of revenue and increased competition  could be justified with the community value add of a vibrant open source offering:

1. **Boxed Software** <br/> We're entering a new era of computing where accessibility is no longer the biggest challenge. Boxed software, remaining important, will do so for different reasons.

2. **PC Speedup Software** <br /> There are about 25 top class PC Optimization tools sold online, some better than others. The biggest problem with these tools is that *most* are unable to actually do what they promise, causing all sorts of problems.

3. **Digital Artists** <br />
Our primary goal with this product was to become equated with the digital art community.

-- <br />
Whilst open sourcing the project would obviously create a large number of challenges, it would also provide an incredible opportunity to develop a vibrant community.


With [FLCleaner 3.0][flcleaner], you're now able to monitor, manage and optimize these resources from a single location.
