It works by scanning files and settings inside a Windows¬Æ PC, removing those you define as unnecessary.

The need is born of junk files and damaged registry settings slowing down certain parts of the system.

Whilst improvements in CPU and RAM have mitigated the wider effects of this, the problem remains and can adversely affect the likes of graphic designers, programmers and others who depend on their systems each day.

<u>Frontline Registry Cleaner 2.0</u> was designed to solve this with a rigid set of scanning options. We've now changed that to enable customization - whereby users are able to add and manage the files/settings the tool scans.

We'll be updating the repository with further instructions soon.
