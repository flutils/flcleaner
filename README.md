[Frontline Registry Cleaner 2.0](https://www.frontlinecleaner.com) was released in 2011 and distributed by several retailers in the UK.

It enables Windows PC users to clean out junk files and corrupted registry settings with a simple scanning system.

In 2022, we revamped the GUI and some of the backend scanning functionality to bring it up to modern standards. We intend to continue to add to this functionality to embrace cloud endpoints and various other additions.

---

#### ‚ÑπÔ∏è How It Works

The redesigned version permits "items" to be created.

These are what the tool scans and come in three types - `settings`, `files` and `security`. 

Users are able to add and manage the "items" they wish to scan, allowing for customizability.

In the future, we want to add the means to include "plugins" that permit pre-packaged items to be added. 

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements

1. [VC++ Redistributable (x86)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)
2. [.NET Core 6.0+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) (x86 or x64 Windows SDK)

When running the app, you will need to an `x86` version of VC++ redistributable.

It does not seem to matter which version you use, as long as it is `x86` compatible. We found that without it, the app will fail citing `FLCleanEngine.dll` being unavailable.

---

#### üö¶ Github Actions

We have now moved the build pipeline to Github Actions.

The build script is triggered when a `tag` is pushed to the repository: -

```
git tag v2.0.0.3-alpha1
git push origin v2.0.0.3-alpha1
```

If you wish to remove the tag, you need to use the following: -

```
git tag -d v2.0.0.3-alpha1
git push -d origin v2.0.0.3-alpha1
```

The build creates a [release](https://github.com/flutils/flcleaner/releases), which contains MSI setup applications for x64 and x86 binaries, as well as zip files with the raw executable & DLL files inside.

The code only runs in x86, so you can ignore x64 entirely.

We're working on integrating signing the various components that require it: -

 - Setup
 - SetupActions (creates a DLL for Setup)
 - FrontlineGUI (main app)
 - FLCleanEngine (cleaner engine DLL)
