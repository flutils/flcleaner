<p align="left"><a href="https://www.frontlinecleaner.com">Frontline Registry Cleaner 2.1</a> is a programmable tool to help remove bloat from Windows. 

It was originally developed by our team in Ukraine and released as a commercial product in 2011. In 2023, we redesigned it for the UK open source community, adding the ability to customize the scanning system.

<p>This repository contains the code for the system. You're welcome to change/contribute to it as you wish: -</p>

Its need comes from the tendancy for Windows¬Æ PC's to collect junk files and erroneous registry settings.

This can happen due to a number of reasons, however, it is mainly through updating Windows and the usage of apps.

Whilst Microsoft provide a ["Disk Cleanup" tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/disk-cleanup-in-windows-8a96ff42-5751-39ad-23d6-434b4d5b9a68), and there are numerous "optimizer" systems that address the issue, none are customizable. We designed 2.1 to permit customizability, allowing people to define which types of files/settings to clean.

If you have questions, you're welcome to [raise an issue](https://github.com/flutils/flcleaner/issues) or send us an email.

We'll eventually be updating [the wiki](https://github.com/flutils/flcleaner/wiki) with information on how it works.
