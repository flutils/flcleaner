## PC Optimization For The 21st Century ##

**[FLCleaner 3.0][flcleaner.com]** is a **stack manager** (designed to optimize computing systems).

Whilst working similarly to other **PC optimization tools**, it has a distinct difference in that it works on the *platform* level, rather than the *system*. Its purpose is to help system administrators manage the [solution stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack) in real time â†´

![FLCleaner 3.0][flcleaner]

-- <br />
All other system optimization software is out of date.

**FLCleaner 3.0** works similarly to PC Optimization tools â†’ checking your system for pre-defined criteria & prompting you to "fix" the problems. The difference lies in *how* it does this.

Current PC Optimization software has a *major* drawback - they *only* work on the system level. This means that they are *all* pre-programmed to identify *specific* elements of the OS, and maybe some higher-level solutions for applications.


With [FLCleaner 3.0][flcleaner.com], you're now able to monitor, manage and optimize these resources from a single location.

## ðŸ‘“ Open Source ðŸ‘“ ##

**Why are you *giving away* the source?**

We're not.

Whilst it would have been logical to kesetreep the source proprietary, we felt the benefits of open source were pronounced.

1. **Boxed Software** <br/> We're entering a new era of computing where accessibility is no longer the biggest challenge. Boxed software, remaining important, will do so for different reasons.

2. **PC Speedup Software** <br /> There are about 25 top class PC Optimization tools sold online, some better than others. The biggest problem with these tools is that *most* are unable to actually do what they promise, causing all sorts of problems.

3. **Digital Artists** <br />
Our primary goal with this product was to become equated with the digital art community.

-- <br />
Whilst open sourcing the project would obviously create a large number of challenges, it would also provide an incredible opportunity to develop a vibrant community.
