## PC Optimization For The 21st Century ##

**[FLCleaner 3.0][flcleaner.com]** is a **stack manager** (designed to optimize computing systems).

Whilst working similarly to other **PC optimization tools**, it has a distinct difference in that it works on the *platform* level, rather than the *system*. Its purpose is to help system administrators manage the [solution stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack) in real time â†´

![FLCleaner 3.0][flcleaner]

-- <br />
**FLCleaner 3.0** works similarly to PC Optimization tools â†’ checking your system for pre-defined criteria & prompting you to "fix" the problems. The difference lies in *how* it does this.

Current PC Optimization software has a **major** drawback - they *only* work on the SYSTEM level. This means that they are *all* pre-programmed to identify *specific* elements of the OS, and maybe some higher-level solutions for applications.

With [FLCleaner 3.0][flcleaner.com], you're now able to monitor, manage and optimize these resources from a single endpoint. Whilst the front-end is completely free, the real benefit lies in the online service, allowing you to manage, upgrade and optimize your system across the full spectrum of modern platforms.

[[ Features ]]

The system is completely object orientated, meaning that it should be relatively simple to use & maintain.

Each time the system loads, it will build the following set of objects:

```
computer:  {
  name:            System.name,
  time:            System.time,
  status:          System.status,
  architecture:    System.architecture,
  manufacturer:    System.manufacturer,
  model:           System.model,
  language:        System.language,
  os: {
    name:          System.os,
    build:         System.os.build,
    version:       System.os.version,
    architecture:  System.os.architecture
  },
  hardware: {
    cpu:         {},
    ram:         {},
    hdd:         {},
    gpu:         {},
    motherboard: {},
    display:     {
      1: {},
      2: {}
    }
  },
  software: {},
  event:    {}
}
```

## ðŸ‘“ Open Source ðŸ‘“ ##

There are two reasons why we open sourced the product.

Firstly, *marketing* a product like this requires people to care. Starting from scratch means you need to do everything within your power to cultivate a community. Open sourcing gives people ownership, and thus would hopefully attract a community.

Secondly, this space is littered with many "faux" products which don't work. We don't really care about making money from this (we have plenty of work), so felt it better to make it open source - providing transparency.

There are also several other reasons:

1. **Boxed Software** <br/> We're entering a new era of computing where accessibility is no longer the biggest challenge. Boxed software, remaining important, will do so for different reasons. Whilst nothing beats having a nice box, it won't be the *sole* way people engage with software.

2. **PC Speedup Software** <br /> There are about 20 top class PC Optimization tools sold online, some better than others. The biggest problem with these tools is that *most* are unable to actually do what they promise, causing all sorts of problems. A handful work well, the rest are garbage.

3. **Digital Artists** <br />
Our primary goal with this product was to become equated with the digital art community. Thus, the product is freely available to help younger artists.

-- <br />
Obviously, open sourcing the project will create a large number of challenges. However, it would also provide an incredible opportunity to develop a vibrant community.
