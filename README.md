"Registry Cleaner" tools were built to repair errors in the Windows "[registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry)" database.

As earlier Windows versions required significant registry maintenance, the tools became popular. As Windows evolved, the need dimished, leading many vendors to switch to speed & security optimization instead.

We found success with "registry cleaner" software in 2009 - achieving positive reviews for our work. We invested into the underlying technology and released [Frontline Registry Cleaner 2.0](https://www.frontlinecleaner.com) in 2011.

In 2012, we switched focus to web based applications, leading us to discontinue our registry repair system. As we've been maintaining the source code for an internal project, we released it as open source in 2015.

In 2023, we updated the design to permit customization.
