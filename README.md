[**Frontline Register Cleaner 2.0**](https://www.frontlinecleaner.com) (released in 2011) was distributed by several retailers in the UK.

We bought the code from a company in Ukraine, promoted it through the Internet and rarely updated it. It was a proprietary engine based on "RegCure" (popular product at the time).

The distribution version requires a licensing server to permit users to log in, which we've now taken down. To compensate, we've removed the registration module, allowing people to use the product for free (if they wish).

If you are interested in this type of product, we have built an [RMM (Remote Monitoring & Management)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_monitoring_and_management) tool ([FLCleaner 3.0](https://www.flcleaner.com)), which supersedes its predecessor by a significant margin. The new product is built around our experience with web centric applications ("cloud"), permitting extensibility.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements

1. [VC++ Redistributable (x86)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)
2. [.NET Framework 4.8+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48)

When running the app, you will need to an `x86` version of VC++ redistributable.

It does not seem to matter which version you use, as long as it is `x86` compatible. We found that without it, the app will fail citing `FLCleanEngine.dll` being unavailable.

---

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Code Signing

3 of the projects inside the solution have "post-build" events to sign the code.

These call the signtool commands required to process the signature. They can be removed if you don't have a certificate - we are not going to distribute our certificate publicly: -

- **1Ô∏è‚É£ FLCleanEngine**<br />
  Signs the DLL which is created to serve the GUI: -
  
  `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.22000.0\x64\signtool.exe" sign /f [[ certificate ]] /p [[ password ]] /fd SHA256 /t http://timestamp.digicert.com /a $(BuiltOuputPath)`
  
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/7rurg3t.jpg" width="600" title="FLCleanEngine Post Build Command" />

  **Update 14/03/2022**
  
  If you open [`FLCleanEngine.vcxproj`](https://github.com/flutils/flcleaner/blob/master/FLCleanEngine/FLCleanEngine.vcxproj) in a text editor and scroll to the bottom, you'll see the certificate `PropertyGroup`. 
  
  Add your path to SignTool.exe in the `<SignToolPath>` macro, as well as populating the `<CertificatePath>` and `<CertificatePassword>` macros, the command should fire.
  
  This is how it should look at the end of the file: -
  
  ```
  <PropertyGroup>
    <CertificatePath>" --- your certificate path --- "</CertificatePath>
    <CertificatePassword>" --- your certificate password --- "</CertificatePassword>
    <SignToolPath>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.22000.0\x64\signtool.exe"</SignToolPath>
    <PostBuildEvent>if not $(SignToolPath) == "" (
       $(SignToolPath) sign /f $(CertificatePath) /p $(CertificatePassword) /fd SHA256 /t http://timestamp.digicert.com /a "$(TargetPath)"
     )
    </PostBuildEvent>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <Target Name="AfterBuild">
    <Message Text="The Project File (with Notepad) Manages The Change PostBuild Event (http://pinter.org/archives/1348)." Importance="high" />
  </Target>
  ```
  
  If you use this method, you do not need to change the `PostBuild` command. 
  
  --
   
- **2Ô∏è‚É£ FrontLineGUI**<br />
  Signs the `FLCleaner2.0.exe` file that's created by VS in the `obj` subdirectory of its project folder. The reason for doing this is to ensure that the EXE is signed when it's added to the setup MSI: -
  
  `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.22000.0\x64\signtool.exe" sign /f [[ certificate ]] /p [[ password ]] /fd SHA256 /t http://timestamp.digicert.com /a "$(ProjectDir)obj\$(ConfigurationName)\$(TargetFileName)"`
  
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Tk1BfOY.jpg" width="450" title="FrontlineGUI Post Build Command" />
  
  **Update 14/03/2022**
  
  If you open [`FrontlineGUI.csproj`](https://github.com/flutils/flcleaner/blob/master/FrontLineGUI/FrontLineGUI.csproj) in a text editor and scroll to the bottom, you'll see the certificate `PropertyGroup`. 
  
  Add your path to SignTool.exe in the `<SignToolPath>` macro, as well as populating the `<CertificatePath>` and `<CertificatePassword>` macros, the command should fire.
  
  This is how it should look at the end of the file: -
  
  ```
  <PropertyGroup>
    <CertificatePath>" --- your certificate path --- "</CertificatePath>
    <CertificatePassword>" --- your certificate password --- "</CertificatePassword>
    <SignToolPath>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.22000.0\x64\signtool.exe"</SignToolPath>
    <PostBuildEvent>if not $(SignToolPath) == "" (
        $(SignToolPath) sign /f $(CertificatePath) /p $(CertificatePassword) /fd SHA256 /t http://timestamp.digicert.com /a "$(ProjectDir)obj\$(ConfigurationName)\$(TargetFileName)"
      )
    </PostBuildEvent>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <Target Name="AfterBuild">
    <Message Text="The Project File (with Notepad) Manages The Change PostBuild Event (http://pinter.org/archives/1348)." Importance="high" />
  </Target>
  ```
  
    If you use this method, you do not need to change the `PostBuild` command. 

  --
  
- **3Ô∏è‚É£ Setup**<br />
  Signed to provide a secure version of the installation software. This is signed with the following post-build event (changeable from the "Properties" menu of the Setup project
  
  `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.22000.0\x64\signtool.exe" sign /f [[ certificate ]] /p [[ password ]] /fd SHA256 /t http://timestamp.digicert.com /a $(TargetPath)`
  
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MsyHRVq.jpg" width="600" title="Setup Post-Build Command" />
  
  As mentioned, because this does not support custom macros, you have to apply the above PostBuild command manually.
    
  --
      
 - **4Ô∏è‚É£ SetupActions**<br />
  Signed to ensure the new SetupActions.dll file (used to provide extra functionality to the MSI setup project) is protected at the code level: -
  
   `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.22000.0\x64\signtool.exe" sign /f [[ certificate ]] /p [[ password ]] /fd SHA256 /t http://timestamp.digicert.com /a "$(ProjectDir)obj\$(ConfigurationName)\$(TargetFileName)"`
  
   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ot0t1MX.jpg" width="450" title="Setup Post-Build Command" />
  
   **Update 14/03/2022**
  
   If you open [SetupActions.csproj](https://github.com/flutils/flcleaner/blob/master/SetupActions/SetupActions.csproj) in a text editor and scroll to the bottom, you'll see the certificate `PropertyGroup`. 
  
   Add your path to SignTool.exe in the `<SignToolPath>` macro, as well as populating the `<CertificatePath>` and `<CertificatePassword>` macros, the command should fire.
  
   This is how it should look at the end of the file: -
  
   ```
   <PropertyGroup>
     <CertificatePath>" --- your certificate path --- "</CertificatePath>
     <CertificatePassword>" --- your certificate password --- "</CertificatePassword>
     <SignToolPath>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.22000.0\x64\signtool.exe"</SignToolPath>
     <PostBuildEvent>if not $(SignToolPath) == "" (
        $(SignToolPath) sign /f $(CertificatePath) /p $(CertificatePassword) /fd SHA256 /t http://timestamp.digicert.com /a "$(ProjectDir)obj\$(ConfigurationName)\$(TargetFileName)"
      )
     </PostBuildEvent>
   </PropertyGroup>
   <Target Name="AfterBuild">
     <Message Text="The Project File (with Notepad) Manages The Change PostBuild Event (http://pinter.org/archives/1348)." Importance="high" />
   </Target>
   ```
  
   If you use this method, you do not need to change the `PostBuild` command.
