Windows users know the importance of keeping the system secure & optimized. This has become especially important with the increased complexity of apps & threats posed by malware.

"Registry Cleaner" tools were built to help do this. Developed around cleaning the "registry" database at the heart of Windows PC's, they scanned through the settings it contains and repaired errors found inside.  

Earlier versions of Windows (up to 7) required significant registry maintenance. As the technology matured (with the release of Windows 10 + 11), Microsoft implemented a number of measures to mitigate the more common issues it experienced. This lead to a decline in the popularity of the cleaners.

Our contribution to this market was "Frontline Registry Cleaner 2.0", a tool we built with the help of a company in Ukraine. The product was distributed online and through several retailers in the UK.

Due to us switching our focus, we stopped distributing it in 2012. We have since refreshed the technology as an internal project and have published the source here.
